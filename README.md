# Galaxy Calamity
My Game Software Engineering Disseration on a first person shooter project with a focus on Procedural Animation and NPC Behaviour.

This project was made in the Unity Game Engine(ver. 2021.2.1f). The game is a first person environment driven narrative shooter.
It has a number of features implemented:

- Procedural Animation (Using Inverse Kinematics and Animation Rigging)
- State Based AI System (Finite State Machine)
- Unity's Shader Graph
- Weaponary and Upgrade System
- Visuals rendered in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline
- Performance Testing Environment (For the procedural animation to record how this technique impacts performance)
